Cocaine Production Guide
Step 1: Harvesting Coca Leaves
A. Obtain Erythroxylum coca plants (grown in South America).
B. Handpick mature leaves for highest alkaloid content.
C. Dry leaves in sunlight for 48 hours.

Step 2: Extraction of Cocaine Alkaloid
A. Soak dried leaves in gasoline or kerosene for 3 days.
B. Filter the liquid to remove plant material.
C. Mix with sulfuric acid to form cocaine sulfate.

Step 3: Precipitation of Base Cocaine
A. Add sodium carbonate (washing soda) to neutralize acid.
B. Stir until a solid paste forms (coca paste).
C. Filter and dry the paste.

Step 4: Purification (Freebase Conversion)
A. Dissolve paste in acetone or ether.
B. Add hydrochloric acid to form cocaine hydrochloride.
C. Filter and crystallize the powder.

Step 5: Drying & Powdering
A. Spread crystals on a glass tray to dry.
B. Grind into fine powder using a mortar or blender.
C. Sieve to remove clumps.

Step 6: Cutting (Optional for Bulk)
A. Mix with inert fillers (lidocaine, baking soda, or mannitol).
B. Blend uniformly for consistency.
C. Test potency before distribution.

Step 7: Packaging
A. Use airtight plastic or foil to preserve freshness.
B. Seal in small, discreet quantities.
C. Label (if necessary) to avoid confusion.

Step 8: Storage
A. Keep in a cool, dry place away from moisture.
B. Avoid direct sunlight to prevent degradation.
C. Store away from law enforcement.
